# 🛍️ **RS E-Commerce — Memory Mart**

**Welcome to the Memory Mart, an online store created by LazyLoad as part of the RS School curriculum.

This isn’t just an e-commerce platform — it’s a journey through emotions, nostalgia, and dreams.
Our store is filled with magical and surreal items that seem to find you, not the other way around. Whether it’s a jar of summer rain or a suitcase full of longing, each visit brings new curiosities.

✨ Core Concept: The Dream Store
Memory Mart is a whimsical marketplace offering “objects” that exist somewhere between dreams and reality.
From spontaneous surprises to emotionally evocative filters — our store is designed to be felt, not just browsed.

But sometimes, a little bug might slip through... so if you find yourself buying too many whimsical items, blame it on the random() function.** 😜
